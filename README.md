# Graphs

A library for Graph-Based Learning in Python.

Provides several types of graphs container objects,
with associated visualization, analysis, and embedding functions.

## TODO list

  * Get test coverage up to 100%
  * Provide specialized graph types for undirected graphs
  * Add a weighted variant of EdgePairGraph
  * Support casting between Graph subtypes
  * Add a graph construction submodule
  * Hook into networkx/graphviz/arbor/etc for no-coordinate graph vizualization
  * Add docstrings to all public functions/classes/modules
  * Provide usage examples
  * Upload to PyPI

## Requirements

Requires recent versions of:

  * numpy
  * scipy
  * scikit-learn
  * matplotlib

Testing requires:

  * nose
  * nose-cov
